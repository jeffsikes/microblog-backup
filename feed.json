I took a lot of beginner courses ([how to navigate the site](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/trailhead_basics), [the career paths](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/career-path), beginner courses for [developer](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/salesforce-developer-quick-look) and [admin](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/salesforce-admin-quick-look)) and finally decided to focus on SF administration, with a light dash of developer knowledge.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, I have been a developer, or at least a manager working side by side with developers. Now in a full managerial mode, I have to remind myself to let others take on the details and focus on the larger picture, helping to guide the team and provide direction toward our end goals.\r\n\r\nNow that I have a clearer picture of my own personal objectives, I am moving into the Admin path and hoping to achieve a certification by Fall 2024 at the latest.\r\n\r\nI'm making a few custodial decision here as I start posting as well:\r\n\r\n* I will use the #Salesforce tag early in each post to ensure reach to interested parties.\r\n* To avoid having posts that have the term Salesforce in them 500 times, I'll refer to it as SF after that initial tag.\r\n* I've setup the blog to request no indexing by search engines. This is basically a journal of my process that I'm happy to share with those that find it on Micro.blog or Mastodon, but otherwise there is no need to be included in larger search engines.\r\n\r\nNext, I want to build out simple /links and /uses page with items specific to the SF journey.\r\n\r\nWish me luck!\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/134708/2023/june5-014.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"A 1940s home built in the United States, updated in the early 2000s.\">\n",
