			 <p>It&rsquo;s been awhile since I posted, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I haven&rsquo;t been Salesforcing. The contract has been signed, and we are negotiating with a vendor for development. In addition, I&rsquo;ve continued using Trailhead and just hit Mountaineer the other day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been focusing in on a few things in relation to our conversion.</p>
<h2 id="the-initial-setup">The Initial Setup</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken some minor steps after being given the keys to our production and sandbox environments. These guides were very useful, although I didn&rsquo;t follow every single recommendation. It was still a great place to start.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
<p>We have tons of third party integrations currently. How will we manage those in Salesforce? I&rsquo;ve gone through several Trails related to Identity and at least have an understanding of how it works. This week, my goal is to implement a SAML login with one of our existing applications and see how it goes.</p>
<h2 id="data-conversion">Data Conversion</h2>
<p>The majority of our data will be converted over directly to Salesforce. But there are bits and pieces that will still reside in our legacy system. How do we combine the two datasets, and how will our legacy applications continue work moving forward?</p>
<h2 id="metrics-and-data-definitions">Metrics and Data Definitions</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also gathered usage metrics from our staff, determined our Subject Matter Experts, and have extracted SQL Schema data with usage metrics and definitions. I plan to utilize a combination of Eleventy and an LLM to generate documentation based on this curated data.</p>

			 <p>After a short detour into ZenDesk, I&rsquo;m back to Salesforce! We&rsquo;ve made some decisions on our product suite. One of my staff said &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all&rdquo;? And I almost fell over lol. There&rsquo;s so much to learn. At least I can focus in on these specific areas now, and guide our subject matter experts in the right direction.</p>

<p>We haven&rsquo;t made the jump to Salesforce YET, but plan to within the year. Lots to do before then.</p>

			 <p>Getting close to completing the Admin Beginner trail. I keep getting surprised with the number of things included with the base #Salesforce implementation compared to our current platform. Today, it was the learning paths and guidance modules that are fairly customizable. Handy.</p>

			 <p>Worked through a few #Salesforce Lightning Experience customizations tonight - views and compact layouts. I see there&rsquo;s an attempt to build responsive views. It&rsquo;s suprisingly good, but I do see that in most cases tweaks would be necessary.</p>

			 <p>Learning about Data Models and the Schema Builder in SF today. It&rsquo;s comforting to see these web based tools and how closely it ties to the raw database. For me as a developer / technical person, anyway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked in systems previously where making these types of changes took much longer, and pulling up a visualization like this would be impossible or take a long time to compile and display.</p>
<p>I wish you could re-order the fields when you add a new one, like if you add a Street Address City, you can&rsquo;t move it to appear after Street Address Line 2. I understand why that&rsquo;s a hassle (you&rsquo;d have to drop the table and recreate it) but it would be nice to have some hidden metadata store the sort values purely for presentational purposes.</p>

			 <p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that micro.blog hides your followers. So I have no idea who is following me. It&rsquo;s quite a shock coming from other platforms, and I&rsquo;m curious how it will affect what I write or who I interact with any differently than if I knew a person was a follower, mutual, or not.</p>

			 <p>Going through the #Salesforce Admin Beginner Trail and got the Adventurer badge. A refresher on databases so far, but in a point and click way rather than creating schemas or using code to create them directly.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s ALSO building the interface for you along the way, which is nice.</p>

			 <p>Many years ago, I bought my first home, and it was a bit of a fixer upper. Built in the late 1940s, it hadn&rsquo;t been updated much since. But it&rsquo;s what I could afford at the time, and I spent several years doing nothing else other than tending to it and making improvements where I could.</p>
<p>When the time came, I sold it for a profit, and was able to purchase a larger home with less work needed.</p>
<p>I feel like this is where I am at work as well. We&rsquo;ve been working fine in an old system, learning its ins and outs, and made the best use of what we had. It&rsquo;s been a success, but it&rsquo;s time to move on to a bigger platform with more room to work! That&rsquo;s where Salesforce comes in.</p>
<p>I initially began Trailhead modules randomly, as I had no idea where to start. I took a lot of beginner courses (<a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/trailhead_basics">how to navigate the site</a>, <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/career-path">the career paths</a>, beginner courses for <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/salesforce-developer-quick-look">developer</a> and <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/salesforce-admin-quick-look">admin</a>) and finally decided to focus on SF administration, with a light dash of developer knowledge.</p>
<p>Until recently, I have been a developer, or at least a manager working side by side with developers. Now in a full managerial mode, I have to remind myself to let others take on the details and focus on the larger picture, helping to guide the team and provide direction toward our end goals.</p>
<p>Now that I have a clearer picture of my own personal objectives, I am moving into the Admin path and hoping to achieve a certification by Fall 2024 at the latest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making a few custodial decision here as I start posting as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will use the #Salesforce tag early in each post to ensure reach to interested parties.</li>
<li>To avoid having posts that have the term Salesforce in them 500 times, I&rsquo;ll refer to it as SF after that initial tag.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve setup the blog to request no indexing by search engines. This is basically a journal of my process that I&rsquo;m happy to share with those that find it on Micro.blog or Mastodon, but otherwise there is no need to be included in larger search engines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, I want to build out simple /links and /uses page with items specific to the SF journey.</p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>
