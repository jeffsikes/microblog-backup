			 <p>I want to start learning keyboard shortcuts for #Salesforce so I can get in the habit of using them. Is this the appropriate list, anyone have some extra special hidden secret ones to share?</p>

			 <p>Worked through a few #Salesforce Lightning Experience customizations tonight - views and compact layouts. I see there&rsquo;s an attempt to build responsive views. It&rsquo;s suprisingly good, but I do see that in most cases tweaks would be necessary.</p>

			 <p>Learning about Data Models and the Schema Builder in SF today. It&rsquo;s comforting to see these web based tools and how closely it ties to the raw database. For me as a developer / technical person, anyway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked in systems previously where making these types of changes took much longer, and pulling up a visualization like this would be impossible or take a long time to compile and display.</p>
<p>I wish you could re-order the fields when you add a new one, like if you add a Street Address City, you can&rsquo;t move it to appear after Street Address Line 2. I understand why that&rsquo;s a hassle (you&rsquo;d have to drop the table and recreate it) but it would be nice to have some hidden metadata store the sort values purely for presentational purposes.</p>

			 <p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that micro.blog hides your followers. So I have no idea who is following me. It&rsquo;s quite a shock coming from other platforms, and I&rsquo;m curious how it will affect what I write or who I interact with any differently than if I knew a person was a follower, mutual, or not.</p>

			 <p>Going through the #Salesforce Admin Beginner Trail and got the Adventurer badge. A refresher on databases so far, but in a point and click way rather than creating schemas or using code to create them directly.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s ALSO building the interface for you along the way, which is nice.</p>

			 <p>Many years ago, I bought my first home, and it was a bit of a fixer upper. Built in the late 1940s, it hadn&rsquo;t been updated much since. But it&rsquo;s what I could afford at the time, and I spent several years doing nothing else other than tending to it and making improvements where I could.</p>
<p>When the time came, I sold it for a profit, and was able to purchase a larger home with less work needed.</p>
<p>I feel like this is where I am at work as well. We&rsquo;ve been working fine in an old system, learning its ins and outs, and made the best use of what we had. It&rsquo;s been a success, but it&rsquo;s time to move on to a bigger platform with more room to work! That&rsquo;s where Salesforce comes in.</p>
<p>I initially began Trailhead modules randomly, as I had no idea where to start. I took a lot of beginner courses (<a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/trailhead_basics">how to navigate the site</a>, <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/career-path">the career paths</a>, beginner courses for <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/salesforce-developer-quick-look">developer</a> and <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/salesforce-admin-quick-look">admin</a>) and finally decided to focus on SF administration, with a light dash of developer knowledge.</p>
<p>Until recently, I have been a developer, or at least a manager working side by side with developers. Now in a full managerial mode, I have to remind myself to let others take on the details and focus on the larger picture, helping to guide the team and provide direction toward our end goals.</p>
<p>Now that I have a clearer picture of my own personal objectives, I am moving into the Admin path and hoping to achieve a certification by Fall 2024 at the latest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making a few custodial decision here as I start posting as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will use the #Salesforce tag early in each post to ensure reach to interested parties.</li>
<li>To avoid having posts that have the term Salesforce in them 500 times, I&rsquo;ll refer to it as SF after that initial tag.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve setup the blog to request no indexing by search engines. This is basically a journal of my process that I&rsquo;m happy to share with those that find it on Micro.blog or Mastodon, but otherwise there is no need to be included in larger search engines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, I want to build out simple /links and /uses page with items specific to the SF journey.</p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>
